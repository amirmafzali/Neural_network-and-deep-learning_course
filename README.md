based on this article i have implemented this idea of how will it be if we change the resolution of cifar10 dataset and train , test the model base on it
there is two approaches such as TOTV and TVTV
TOTV is an approach that is used in this article. it's gonna train model base on the main resolution but test the model on the diffrent resolution.
TVTV is an approach that is used in this article. it' gonna train and test base on each resolution.
