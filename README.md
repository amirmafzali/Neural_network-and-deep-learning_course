 I have implemented how the evaluation criterias will be if we change the resolution of cifar10 dataset and train , test the model base on it.

there is two approaches such as TOTV and TVTV.

TOTV, train model base on the main resolution but test the model by the diffrent resolution.
TVTV, train and test model base on each resolution.
